[Learn to Read the Source, Luke](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/learn-to-read-the-source-luke.html)

Jeff Atwood explains why reading code is such a vital skill for good programmers. The best quotes:

< No matter what the documentation says, the source code is the ultimate truth, the best and most definitive and up-to-date documentation you're likely to find. This will be true forever, so the sooner you come to terms with this, the better off you'll be as a software developer.

< Sometimes, the documentation isn't complete. Sometimes, it's wrong. The source code never lies. For an experienced developer, reading the source can often be faster… especially if you're already familiar with the package's architecture. I'm in a medium-sized co-working space with several startups. A lot of the other CTOs and engineers come to our team for guidance and advice on occasion. When people report a problem with their stack, the first question I ask them is: "Well, did you read the source code?" 
[from an epic Brandon Bloom [post](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3769446)]

< Nobody reads other people's code for fun. Hell, I don't even like reading my own code.

< We must read other people's code because we have to understand it to get things done
