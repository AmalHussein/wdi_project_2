- A high-level overview of what you can do to improve your programming skills by reading code.
- The latter half of the list is something we could likely focus on.

[Learn to Read the Source, Luke](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/learn-to-read-the-source-luke.html)

Jeff Atwood explains why reading code is such a vital skill for good programmers. The best quotes:

< No matter what the documentation says, the source code is the ultimate truth, the best and most definitive 
< and up-to-date documentation you're likely to find. This will be true forever, so the sooner you come to terms
< with this, the better off you'll be as a software developer.

< Sometimes, the documentation isn't complete. Sometimes, it's wrong. The source code never lies.
< For an experienced developer, reading the source can often be fasterâ€¦ especially if you're already familiar
< with the package's architecture. I'm in a medium-sized co-working space with several startups. A lot of the
< other CTOs and engineers come to our team for guidance and advice on occasion. When people report a problem
< with their stack, the first question I ask them is: "Well, did you read the source code?" 
[from an epic Brandon Bloom [post](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3769446)]

< Nobody reads other people's code for fun. Hell, I don't even like reading my own code.

< We must read other people's code because we have to understand it to get things done.
