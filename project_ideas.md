###Code reader 
-categorize github code/repos by lang, subject
-provide curated resources to help user learn the material
-Coder see, coder do, basically.


##Issue Board Idea
-Open issues on github
-Sort by language, maybe skillset, type of issue
-create UI for coders that want to get involved in OS projects, but are intimidated in starting
